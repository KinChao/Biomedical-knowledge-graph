Q9NPB9	ACKR4_HUMAN	reviewed	Atypical chemokine receptor 4 (C-C chemokine receptor type 11) (C-C CKR-11) (CC-CKR-11) (CCR-11) (CC chemokine receptor-like 1) (CCRL1) (CCX CKR)	ACKR4 CCBP2 CCR11 CCRL1 VSHK1	Homo sapiens (Human)	350	FUNCTION: Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CCL13, CCL19, CCL21 and CCL25. Chemokine-binding does not activate G-protein-mediated signal transduction but instead induces beta-arrestin recruitment, leading to ligand internalization. Plays an important role in controlling the migration of immune and cancer cells that express chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCR9, by reducing the availability of CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 through internalization. Negatively regulates CXCR3-induced chemotaxis. Regulates T-cell development in the thymus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10706668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23121557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23341447}.

Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif.

O94805	ACL6B_HUMAN	reviewed	Actin-like protein 6B (53 kDa BRG1-associated factor B) (Actin-related protein Baf53b) (ArpNalpha) (BRG1-associated factor 53B) (BAF53B)	ACTL6B ACTL6 BAF53B	Homo sapiens (Human)	426	FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Belongs to the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex), as such plays a role in remodeling mononucleosomes in an ATP-dependent fashion, and is required for postmitotic neural development and dendritic outgrowth. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. ACTL6B/BAF53B is not essential for assembly of the nBAF complex but is required for targeting the complex and CREST to the promoter of genes essential for dendritic growth (By similarity). Essential for neuronal maturation and dendrite development (PubMed:31031012). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99MR0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31031012, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.
